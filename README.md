# Transmission-Line-GUI

Open and run 'translinesMAIN.m' - the rest should be self-explanatory (if you know about power transmission line modelling).

Functions for calculating input and output voltages and currents for different models:
 shortlinefunc.m
 Tlinefunc.m
 pilinefunc.m
 
Update function updates GUI on uicontrol callbacks (sliders):
 updatel.m
